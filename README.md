 # 🎓 Student Dropout Prediction Project

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict which students are at risk of dropping out, based on academic, demographic, and behavioral data. The goal is to support institutions in early identification and intervention for at-risk students.

## 📊 Project Overview

Educational institutions face challenges in retaining students, especially those vulnerable due to academic performance, socioeconomic factors, or other personal struggles. This project applies data science to address this issue.

Key components:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation
- Predictive analysis using classification models
